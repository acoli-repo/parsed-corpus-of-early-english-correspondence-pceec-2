# ACoLi edition of PCEEC2

See [`README.rst`](README7.rst) for the original readme, acknowledgements and license information. 

Note that (in accordance with the OTA license), we do not (re-)release any PCEEC2 data. However, as this is a fork of Beatrice Santorini's repository, the PCEEC2 data is *forked*.

The purpose of this repository is to provide additional scripts for extracting and enriching the data. ACoLi additions are in the [`acoli/`](acoli) directory, see the Readme file there.
